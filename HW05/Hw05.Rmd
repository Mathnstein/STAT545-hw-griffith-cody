### Factor Management

Step goals:

* Define factor variables;
* Drop factor/levels;
* Reorder levels based on knowldge from data.

### Gapminder version:

**Drop Oceania** Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

#### Dropping Oceania

This will drop any values in the continent column that take "Oceania".
```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

summary(gapminder)
summary(gapminder_no_oceania)

```
In the summaries we see that the Oceania factor under continent previously had 24 entries, and now has 0.

Next we will drop the factor altogether,
```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania <- gapminder_no_oceania %>% 
  droplevels()
summary(gapminder)
summary(gapminder_no_oceania)
```
Here we no longer have any trace of the Oceania continent and we can see that here.
```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder_no_oceania$continent)
```


**Reorder the levels of country or continent** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.
 
Here I use 'fct_reorder' to reorder by population. I also choose to use the "max" as a summary statistic, as I want to see the maximum over each year and order by this.
```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder_no_oceania$country,gapminder_no_oceania$pop,fun = max, .desc = TRUE) %>% levels() %>% 
  head()
```


We can also order by other variables, like gdpPercap, where here it may make more sense to average our entires with mean.
```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder$country,gapminder$gdpPercap,fun = mean, .desc= TRUE) %>% levels() %>% 
  head()
```
Where we see that Kuwait is the country with the highest average gdpPercap!

For a little less of an interesting ordering, here are the continents ordered by average gdpPercap.
```{r}
fct_reorder(gapminder_no_oceania$continent,gapminder_no_oceania$gdpPercap,fun = mean, .desc = TRUE) %>% levels() %>% 
  head()
```
With Europe leading the way in average gdpPercap.

Inside of a ggplot, lets consider the most recent gdpPercap for Europe.

```{r}
only_europe <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe",year == 2007) %>% 
  droplevels()
goodplot <- only_europe %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(country,gdpPercap),y=gdpPercap))+
  geom_col(color = "blue",alpha=.2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  labs(x = "Country", y = "GDP per Capita")
goodplot
```
Now comparing this to an arrangement instead.
```{r}
only_europe <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe",year == 2007) %>% 
  droplevels()
badplot <- only_europe %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=country,y=gdpPercap))+
  geom_col(color = "blue",alpha=.2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  labs(x = "Country", y = "GDP per Capita")
badplot
```
We can see this did not do what we intended for at all, where we asked the data to be arranged by gdpPercap and not alphebetically. 

Just to check that things are indeed working like they're supposed to,
```{r}
arranged_europe <- arrange(only_europe,gdpPercap)
 arranged_europe %>% 
  glimpse() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Which is proper, in a ggplot, it seems that the factor reordering is taking priority over the arrange function.

### File I/O

Here I will save the ordered data Europe's 2007 entries.
```{r}
write.csv(arranged_europe,"arranged_europe.csv")
```

Clearing the entire environment and loading this csv gives,
```{r}
read_file <- read.csv("arranged_europe.csv")
```

Comparing the two,
```{r}
head(arranged_europe)
head(read_file)
```
Here we note that an extra column was added that is a duplicate of the row numbers. Outside of this the two are identical.



### Writing figures to file

Use `ggsave()` to explicitly write a figure to file. Then use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to embed it in your report. Things to play around with:

  * Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
  * Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
  * Explicit provision of the plot object `p` via `ggsave(..., plot = p)`. Show a situation in which this actually matters.
  
  
```{r}
ggsave("Euro_gdp_inc.pdf",goodplot,width=20,height=20,units="cm")
```

I now have a csv and a pdf on my local computer! Here is an embedding of the image
