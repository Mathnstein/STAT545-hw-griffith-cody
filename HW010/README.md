## Reflection

While working through this assignment, it became clear to me that understanding the architecture of an html page is the basis of learning how to pull information from it. I had tried a fewother sources for a data set but it became clear that without a simple page that has an easy to crack class list, it can be a real pain trying to unfold the nested class tags.

Using regular expresions and cleaning the data set also was a bit annoying, but this is the price that must be paid without actually having access to the original data set. Once the data had been cleaned up, the rest followed very naturally!
