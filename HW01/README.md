Hey Vincenzo! 

## I'm editing this within the browser.

Hello! My name is Cody Griffith and I'm studing for my Master's in Mathematics at UBC! I love to snowboard and recently learned how to surf. I try to spend most of my time at the beach because until Vancouver, I'd never really seen a beach before. I'm new to using git and github but I am not new to programming and pick up skills like this rather quickly. Very excited to standardize my workflow a bit in preparation for working in larger teams!

## Everything here on is done locally!

### Here is some latex code

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x}\,dx=1$$

I didn't know that RStudio can display **latex** within the notebook. That is pretty cool.

I realize that if I tried to input R code here, it would not be evaluated as this is just a markdown file. I would need to either run it in R then output that here or use a Rmd file to do exactly that in one go.

After Thursday's class, I realize my previous terminology is all wrong. This is a markdown file and was not created as a Rmd. I did on the otherhand create a seperate Rmd called [hw01_gapminder.Rmd](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw01-Griffith-Cody/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.Rmd). It produces the [hw01_gapminder.md](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw01-Griffith-Cody/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) with all the r code evaluated and the plots inserted related to the Gapminder dataset.

I personally really enjoy R markdown as I'm used to having to import files into Latex where I performed my analysis on *Matlab* or *Mathematica*. The ability to contain all the work in one location is very cool.
