# HW 07

Here is the explanation of the pipeline for the gapminder dataset

* First script: download some data: [00_downloader.R](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw-griffith-cody/blob/master/HW07/00_downloader.R)
* Second script: read the data, order it, make a few plots from the data, write out an ordered file [01_exploratory.R](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw-griffith-cody/blob/master/HW07/01_exploratory.R)
Third script: Perform statistical analysis and make plots over each continent [02_statistical.R]()
Fourth script: The master file to run this pipeline [master.R]()
A fifth script to rule them all, i.e. to run the others in sequence: Makefile
